Performed the driver-navigator approach throughout the development of the entire project.

## About

The user can use this application to set goals for their health and productivity, tied to an amount of time. Users will select an activity category, set the amount of time they want to spend on that activity, and start the timer. The app will log that activity to keep track of how the user has been spending their time.

## Setup

One partner will;
- Create a `repo` in github
- `git clone` the `repo`
- Add `src` directory containing `main.js` and `activity.js`
- Add `index.html` and `styles.css` files
- Add `assets` directory
- Add all teammates and instructors as collaborators

  - Semantic HTML
  - Clean & organized CSS styles
  - DRY and organized JavaScript
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements
